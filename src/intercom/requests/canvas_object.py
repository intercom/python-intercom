    You have to respond to the majority of requests with a canvas object. This will tell us what UI to show for your app.

    A canvas can either be static (meaning we send you the next request only when an action takes place) or live (meaning we send you the next request when someone views the app).

    - A static canvas needs a ContentObject which will contain the components to show.
    - A live canvas needs a `content_url` which we we will make the Live Canvas requests to when the app is viewed. This is only possible for apps viewed or used in the Messenger.
