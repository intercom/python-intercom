                - `missed`: If there are any missed sla_events for the conversation and no canceled events. If there’s even a single missed sla event, the status will always be missed. A missed status is not applied when the SLA expires, only the next time a teammate replies.
                - `active`: An SLA has been applied to a conversation, but has not yet been fulfilled. SLA status is active only if there are no “hit, “missed”, or “canceled” events.
