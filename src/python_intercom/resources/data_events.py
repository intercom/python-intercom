        Once
        you have a key you can submit events via POST to the Events resource, which is
        located at https://api.intercom.io/events, or you can send events using one of
        the client libraries. When working with the HTTP API directly a client should
        send the event with a `Content-Type` of `application/json`.

        When using the JavaScript API,
        [adding the code to your app](http://docs.intercom.io/configuring-Intercom/tracking-user-events-in-your-app)
        makes the Events API available. Once added, you can submit an event using the
        `trackEvent` method. This will associate the event with the Lead or currently
        logged-in user or logged-out visitor/lead and send it to Intercom. The final
        parameter is a map that can be used to send optional metadata about the event.

        With the Ruby client you pass a hash describing the event to
        `Intercom::Event.create`, or call the `track_user` method directly on the
        current user object (e.g. `user.track_event`).

        **Lead Events**

        When submitting events for Leads, you will need to specify the Lead's `id`.

        **Metadata behaviour**

        - We currently limit the number of tracked metadata keys to 10 per event. Once
          the quota is reached, we ignore any further keys we receive. The first 10
          metadata keys are determined by the order in which they are sent in with the
          event.
        - It is not possible to change the metadata keys once the event has been sent. A
          new event will need to be created with the new keys and you can archive the
          old one.
        - There might be up to 24 hrs delay when you send a new metadata for an existing
          event.

        **Event de-duplication**

        The API may detect and ignore duplicate events. Each event is uniquely
        identified as a combination of the following data - the Workspace identifier,
        the Contact external identifier, the Data Event name and the Data Event created
        time. As a result, it is **strongly recommended** to send a second granularity
        Unix timestamp in the `created_at` field.

        Duplicated events are responded to using the normal `202 Accepted` code - an
        error is not thrown, however repeat requests will be counted against any rate
        limit that is in place.

        ### HTTP API Responses

        - Successful responses to submitted events return `202 Accepted` with an empty
          body.
        - Unauthorised access will be rejected with a `401 Unauthorized` or
          `403 Forbidden` response code.
        - Events sent about users that cannot be found will return a `404 Not Found`.
        - Event lists containing duplicate events will have those duplicates ignored.
        - Server errors will return a `500` response code and may contain an error
          message in the body.

        With the Ruby client you pass a hash describing the event to
        `Intercom::Event.create`, or call the `track_user` method directly on the
        current user object (e.g. `user.track_event`).

        **Lead Events**

        When submitting events for Leads, you will need to specify the Lead's `id`.

        **Metadata behaviour**

        - We currently limit the number of tracked metadata keys to 10 per event. Once
          the quota is reached, we ignore any further keys we receive. The first 10
          metadata keys are determined by the order in which they are sent in with the
          event.
        - It is not possible to change the metadata keys once the event has been sent. A
          new event will need to be created with the new keys and you can archive the
          old one.
        - There might be up to 24 hrs delay when you send a new metadata for an existing
          event.

        **Event de-duplication**

        The API may detect and ignore duplicate events. Each event is uniquely
        identified as a combination of the following data - the Workspace identifier,
        the Contact external identifier, the Data Event name and the Data Event created
        time. As a result, it is **strongly recommended** to send a second granularity
        Unix timestamp in the `created_at` field.

        Duplicated events are responded to using the normal `202 Accepted` code - an
        error is not thrown, however repeat requests will be counted against any rate
        limit that is in place.

        ### HTTP API Responses

        - Successful responses to submitted events return `202 Accepted` with an empty
          body.
        - Unauthorised access will be rejected with a `401 Unauthorized` or
          `403 Forbidden` response code.
        - Events sent about users that cannot be found will return a `404 Not Found`.
        - Event lists containing duplicate events will have those duplicates ignored.
        - Server errors will return a `500` response code and may contain an error
          message in the body.

        **Lead Events**

        When submitting events for Leads, you will need to specify the Lead's `id`.

        **Metadata behaviour**

        - We currently limit the number of tracked metadata keys to 10 per event. Once
          the quota is reached, we ignore any further keys we receive. The first 10
          metadata keys are determined by the order in which they are sent in with the
          event.
        - It is not possible to change the metadata keys once the event has been sent. A
          new event will need to be created with the new keys and you can archive the
          old one.
        - There might be up to 24 hrs delay when you send a new metadata for an existing
          event.

        **Event de-duplication**

        The API may detect and ignore duplicate events. Each event is uniquely
        identified as a combination of the following data - the Workspace identifier,
        the Contact external identifier, the Data Event name and the Data Event created
        time. As a result, it is **strongly recommended** to send a second granularity
        Unix timestamp in the `created_at` field.

        Duplicated events are responded to using the normal `202 Accepted` code - an
        error is not thrown, however repeat requests will be counted against any rate
        limit that is in place.

        ### HTTP API Responses

        - Successful responses to submitted events return `202 Accepted` with an empty
          body.
        - Unauthorised access will be rejected with a `401 Unauthorized` or
          `403 Forbidden` response code.
        - Events sent about users that cannot be found will return a `404 Not Found`.
        - Event lists containing duplicate events will have those duplicates ignored.
        - Server errors will return a `500` response code and may contain an error
          message in the body.

        logged-in user or logged-out visitor/lead and send it to Intercom. The final
        parameter is a map that can be used to send optional metadata about the event.

        With the Ruby client you pass a hash describing the event to
        `Intercom::Event.create`, or call the `track_user` method directly on the
        current user object (e.g. `user.track_event`).

        **Lead Events**

        When submitting events for Leads, you will need to specify the Lead's `id`.

        **Metadata behaviour**

        - We currently limit the number of tracked metadata keys to 10 per event. Once
          the quota is reached, we ignore any further keys we receive. The first 10
          metadata keys are determined by the order in which they are sent in with the
          event.
        - It is not possible to change the metadata keys once the event has been sent. A
          new event will need to be created with the new keys and you can archive the
          old one.
        - There might be up to 24 hrs delay when you send a new metadata for an existing
          event.

        **Event de-duplication**

        The API may detect and ignore duplicate events. Each event is uniquely
        identified as a combination of the following data - the Workspace identifier,
        the Contact external identifier, the Data Event name and the Data Event created
        time. As a result, it is **strongly recommended** to send a second granularity
        Unix timestamp in the `created_at` field.

        Duplicated events are responded to using the normal `202 Accepted` code - an
        error is not thrown, however repeat requests will be counted against any rate
        limit that is in place.

        ### HTTP API Responses

        - Successful responses to submitted events return `202 Accepted` with an empty
          body.
        - Unauthorised access will be rejected with a `401 Unauthorized` or
          `403 Forbidden` response code.
        - Events sent about users that cannot be found will return a `404 Not Found`.
        - Event lists containing duplicate events will have those duplicates ignored.
        - Server errors will return a `500` response code and may contain an error
          message in the body.
